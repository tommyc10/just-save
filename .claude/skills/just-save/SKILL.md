just-fucking-cancel

Analyze transactions, categorize subscriptions, generate HTML audit, help cancel.

Workflow

1. Get Transaction CSV

Ask user for bank/card CSV export. Common sources:

Apple Card: Wallet → Card Balance → Export
Chase: Accounts → Download activity → CSV
Mint: Transactions → Export
2. Analyze Recurring Charges

Read CSV, identify recurring patterns:

Same merchant, similar amounts, monthly/annual frequency
Flag subscription-like charges (streaming, SaaS, memberships)
Note charge frequency and total annual cost
3. Categorize with User

For each subscription, ask user to categorize:

Cancel - Stop immediately
Investigate - Needs decision (unsure, trapped in contract)
Keep - Intentional, continue paying
Ask in batches of 5-10 to avoid overwhelming.

4. Generate HTML Audit

Copy template.html and populate:

Update header summary:
Scope line: "found N subscriptions · N transactions"
Breakdown: "Cancelled N · Keeping N"
Savings: yearly amount big, monthly in parentheses
Timestamp: current date
Add rows to appropriate sections (cancelled/investigate/keep)
Include notes from user responses
Row templates in the HTML comments show the structure.

5. Cancel Subscriptions

When user checks items and copies from floating button, they'll paste: Cancel these: Service1 ($XX), Service2 ($XX)...

For each service:

Check common-services.md for cancel URL
Use browser automation to navigate and cancel
Update HTML row to cancelled status with date
